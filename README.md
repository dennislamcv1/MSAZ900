### Applied Learning Project

Learners will engage in interactive exercises throughout this program that offers opportunities to practice and implement what they are learning. They use the Microsoft Learn Sandbox. This a free environment that allows learners to explore Microsoft Azure and get hands-on with live Microsoft Azure resources and services.

For example, when they learn about creating a SQL database, they will work in a temporary Azure environment called the Sandbox. The beauty about this is that you will be working with real technology but in a controlled environment, which allows you to apply what you learn, and at your own pace.

You will need a Microsoft account to sign into the Sandbox. If you don't have one, you can create one for free. The Learn Sandbox allows free, fixed-time access to a cloud subscription with no credit card required. Learners can safely explore, create, and manage resources without the fear of incurring costs or "breaking production".
